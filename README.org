#+title: EASI: the Emacs Advanced Searching Interface

*THIS PROJECT IS IN A VERY ALPHA STATE*

* Overview
Easi lets you search multiple information sources at once---it is a
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_search][federated search]] system in Emacs. Search engines or other sources of
information are declared once in the init file and arbitrary groups
can be used together. After searching, the results are collected
together, sorted, and presented in Emacs. They can be viewed as a
whole collection or individually, or both. Configurable and
user-defined actions can be run on the results. Every aspect of Easi's
operation is meant to be highly configurable.

* Prior art
This package was largely inspired by [[https://github.com/hrs/engine-mode/][engine mode]], and the search
facilities in w3m.
